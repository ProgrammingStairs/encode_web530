1.Write a Java program using JDBC to fetch all student names from the students table and store them into an ArrayList<String>.
After storing, sort the list alphabetically and print it.

2. Check whether array is palindrome or not

3. Reverse words of all the string entered by the user 
 input : Hello user how are you ? 
 output : ? you are how user Hello

4. Example showing the concept of refe rence to a constructor example.

1️⃣ What is JDBC? Explain its architecture.
Include DriverManager, Connection, Statement, ResultSet, and Drivers.

2️⃣ What are different types of JDBC drivers?
Explain Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, Type-4 drivers.

3️⃣ What is the difference between Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement?
4️⃣ What is ResultSet? What are different types of ResultSet?
Explain TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE.

5️⃣ What is JDBC batch processing? Why is it used?
6️⃣ What is the purpose of Class.forName() in JDBC?
7️⃣ Why should we close JDBC resources? Which resources must be closed?

Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement, ResultSet.

8️⃣ What is connection pooling? Why is it useful in JDBC?
9️⃣ What are the main interfaces in the Java Collections Framework?

List, Set, Map, Queue, Iterator.

🔟 Differentiate between ArrayList and LinkedList.
1️⃣1️⃣ What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
1️⃣2️⃣ What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
1️⃣3️⃣ How does Collections.sort() work? What interface must objects implement to be sortable?

Comparable or Comparator.

1️⃣4️⃣ What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?
1️⃣5️⃣ Why do we store database records in Java Collections?

Explain benefits: caching, sorting, filtering, iteration, in-memory operations.

1️⃣ What is a Database Connection in JDBC?
A physical link between the Java application and the database created using DriverManager.getConnection().

2️⃣ What is the role of DriverManager in JDBC?
It loads and manages database drivers and establishes connections to the database.

3️⃣ What is PreparedStatement? Why is it preferred over Statement?
It is a precompiled SQL statement which

prevents SQL Injection
increases performance
supports dynamic parameters (?)

4️⃣ What is the purpose of setAutoCommit(false)?
It disables auto-commit mode so multiple SQL operations can be grouped as a transaction.

5️⃣ What is a Transaction in JDBC?
A group of SQL statements executed as a single unit.
If any operation fails → rollback; else commit.

6️⃣ What is Savepoint in JDBC?
A checkpoint in a transaction from where you can roll back partially.

7️⃣ What is CallableStatement?
It is used to call stored procedures and functions in the database.

8️⃣ What is Iterator in Collections?
Used to iterate over List/Set elements one by one with hasNext() and next() methods.

9️⃣ What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Iterator → forward traversal only

ListIterator → forward + backward traversal, but only works for List

🔟 What is the difference between List and Set?
List → ordered, allows duplicates
Set → unordered, does NOT allow duplicates

1️⃣1️⃣ What is a Map in Java?
A collection of key-value pairs where keys must be unique (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).

1️⃣2️⃣ What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
Feature	HashMap	Hashtable
Thread Safe	❌ No	✔ Yes
Performance	Faster	Slower
Null Keys/Values	Allowed	Not Allowed

1️⃣3️⃣ What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
Fail-fast → throws ConcurrentModificationException if structure is modified (e.g., ArrayList Iterator).
Fail-safe → works on a copy, no exception (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap iterator).

1️⃣4️⃣ What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?
Autoboxing → converting primitive to wrapper class automatically
Unboxing → converting wrapper class back to primitive

Example:

int x = 10;  
Integer y = x; // autoboxing  
int z = y; // unboxing

1️⃣5️⃣ Why is Collections Framework used in Java?
Because it provides
reusable data structures
algorithms (sort, search)
performance optimization
type safety (generics)
easy iteration

reduces coding effort

1️⃣ What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language that uses the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to run code.

2️⃣ What is JDK, JRE, and JVM?
JDK (Java Development Kit): Tools + compiler + JRE
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): JVM + libraries
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode

3️⃣ What is OOPS? Name OOPS principles.
4️⃣ What is the difference between Class and Object?
5️⃣ What is Constructor? Types?
6️⃣ What is Method Overloading and Overriding?
7️⃣ What is the difference between Abstract Class and Interface?
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Methods	Can have both abstract & non-abstract	Only abstract (till Java 7), + default/static from Java 8
Multiple Inheritance	❌ No	✔ Yes
Variables	final or non-final	Always public static final
8️⃣ What is the use of this keyword?
9️⃣ What is super keyword?
🔟 What is final keyword?
1️⃣1️⃣ What is Exception Handling?
1️⃣2️⃣ What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
1️⃣3️⃣ What is a package?
1️⃣4️⃣ What is multithreading?
1️⃣5️⃣ Life cycle of a thread?
