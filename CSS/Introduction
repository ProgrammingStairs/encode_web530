Limitation of HTML : 
--------------------
1. No specific property for increasing size, in case of HTML we use <big> tag.
2. We cannot customize div(section) size.
3. Here we need to use table tag for dealing with sections for grid layout.
4. Its difficult to manage the complete webpage with single table tag
5. Usage of multiple table tag for creating web page is not good practise.
6. Less properties 
7. We cannot resize fieldset width
8. we cannot change mark background color
9. Its quite difficult to manage images.

CSS : 
----
1. Full form of CSS is Cascading Style Sheet
2. Css was developed by W3C (World wide web consortium) under the contributiom of Hakon wium lie to simplify the work of designers.
3. As Html provides structure of a web page, where as css gives styling effects to our web page.
4. As Html works on tags, Css works on properties corresponding to its value.
5.  We can implement css by three ways : 
    a. Inline CSS 
    b. Internal CSS 
    c. External CSS 
6. Out of this three ways to implement CSS, priority goes to inline css but recommended way to use css is external css.
