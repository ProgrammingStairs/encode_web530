Node.js Modules
----------------------------
The modules(A set of functions you want to include in your application) in Node.js represents various functionalities that are bundled up into single or multiple JS files. These modules have a unique context, thus, they never interfere nor pollute the scope of other modules.

[ NOTE ] The module.exports is a special object which is included in every JS file in the Node.js application by default. Use module.exports to expose a function, object or variable as a module in Node.js.

These modules enable the code reusability and enhance the ease of usage. Node.js basically provides three types of modules:

1) Core Modules
2) Local Modules
3) Third-Party Modules

1)Core Module(Built-in Modules)
-------------------------------------------------------
Since Node.js is a very lightweight framework, the core modules bundle the absolute minimum functionalities(refers to the features and other functionality that certain tool developers must offer). These modules generally get loaded when the Node process starts its execution. All you need to do is, import these core modules in order to use them in your code.

Below I have listed down a few of the important Core modules.

Core 			                     Module Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http			                   Contains classes, methods, and events required to create Node.js HTTP server
url			                         Contains methods for URL resolution and parsing in Node
querystring		          Contains methods to deal with a query string of Node
path			                    Contains methods to deal with file paths
fs			                         Contains classes, methods, and events to work with file I/O
util			                       Contains utility functions that can be useful for programmers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can load your core module, using the below code:

var module = require('module_name');

To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:

var http = require('http');
Now your application has access to the HTTP module

----------------------------------------
what are Local Modules
----------------------------------------

The local modules of Node.js are custom modules that are created locally by user/developer in the application. These modules can include various functionalities bundled into distinct files and folders which can be easily distributed in the Node.js  community using NPM.

These modules are loaded in a similar way to core modules. Let show you, how to do it using a basic example.

Create your custom/local module.js file
-----------------------------------------------------------------

var detail = {
  name: function (name) {
    console.log('Name: ' + name);
  },
  domain:function (domain) {
    console.log('Domain: ' + domain);
  }
};
 
module.exports = detail;

Include your module file in your main application file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
var myLogModule = require('./Local_module.js');
myLogModule.name('Edureka');
myLogModule.domain('Education');

Now you can execute these files using below command:

node application.js

----------------------------------------------
what are External Modules
----------------------------------------------

You can use the external or 3rd party modules only by downloading them via NPM. These modules are generally developed 
by other developers and are free to use. Few of the best external modules are express, react, gulp, mongoose, mocha etc.

Globally Loading the 3rd party modules:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
npm install --g <module_name>

Include your module file in your main application file:

npm install --save <module_name>

Note : when we print module then we will get this : 
{
  id: 'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node content\\node_programs\\5 modules\\module2.js',
  path: 'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node content\\node_programs\\5 modules',
  exports: {},
  filename: 'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node content\\node_programs\\5 modules\\module2.js',
  loaded: false,
  children: [],
  paths: [
    'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node content\\node_programs\\5 modules\\node_modules',
    'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node content\\node_programs\\node_modules',
    'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node content\\node_modules',
    'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\Node practice content\\node_modules',
    'E:\\Infobeans_Madhovastika\\node_modules',
    'E:\\node_modules'
  ]
}

Node.js will start searching for the required module in the first directory, and if the module is not found there, it will proceed to the next directory in the list until it either finds the module or exhausts all search paths.

If the required module is not found in this directory, Node.js will proceed to the next directory in the list and continue searching. It will only move on to the `E:\node_modules` directory if the module is not found in any of the preceding directories.

Note : if module is not found in E:\node_modules then what will happens : 
If the required module is not found in any of the directories listed in the `module.paths` array, including the `E:\node_modules` directory, Node.js will throw a `ModuleNotFoundError` indicating that it was unable to locate the module.

This error typically looks like:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'module_name'

Common reasons for encountering this error include:

1. **Module Not Installed:** The module you are trying to require might not be installed in any of the listed directories, both locally and globally.

2. **Typo in Module Name:** There might be a typo in the module name specified in the `require` statement.

3. **Incorrect Path:** If the module is meant to be local to your project and you're using a relative path in the `require` statement, the path might be incorrect.

4. **Missing or Corrupted `node_modules`:** Sometimes, issues with the `node_modules` directory, such as missing or corrupted files, can also lead to this error.

To resolve this issue, you would need to ensure that the required module is installed correctly in one of the directories listed in `module.paths`. This might involve reinstalling the module using `npm install`, verifying the module name, checking the relative path if applicable, and confirming that the required module is indeed accessible from the paths mentioned in `module.paths`.
